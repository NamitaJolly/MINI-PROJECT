        "content": "Pope Francis will be discharged from Rome's Gemelli hospital on Sunday, doctors treating him have said.\nThe 88-year-old was admitted to the hospital on 14 February with double pneumonia. \nDuring the past five weeks, he presented \"two very critical episodes\" where his \"life was in danger\", according to Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope.\nPope Francis was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented, Dr Alfieri said. The Pope is now in a stable condition and will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican.\n\"Today we are happy to say that tomorrow he will be at home,\" Dr Alfieri told reporters on Saturday.\nThe Vatican had said on Friday that the Pope had seen some improvements in his breathing and mobility.\nIt had confirmed he no longer uses mechanical ventilation for breathing at night, but was instead receiving oxygen via a small tube under his nose. During the day, he is using less high-flow oxygen. \nThe Pope has only been seen by the public once since he was admitted to hospital, in a photograph released by the Vatican last week, which showed him praying in a hospital chapel.\nEarlier this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City.\nHis voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers.\nThe Cardinal, who is head of the Vatican's doctrinal office, dismissed speculation that the pontiff would follow his predecessor Benedict XVI and resign the papacy.\nWhen asked if he thought the pope could be discharged in time for Easter which falls on 20 April, the Cardinal said he did not know.\nPope Francis has spent nearly 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church.\nHe has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21, making him more prone to infections.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "published": "Sat, 22 Mar 2025 05:46:59 GMT",
        "content": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has ruled out \"tax and spend\" policies, signalling that she will neither raise taxes nor government budgets in her critical Spring Statement next week.\nSpeaking in a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, Reeves also warned that the government could not afford the kinds of spending increases seen under the last Labour government.\nShe is expected to make cuts to some government departments on Wednesday. More money has already been allocated to defence by reducing the aid budget.\n\"We can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That's not available in the world we live in today,\" she said.\nIn her autumn Budget, Reeves increased the levels of tax and public spending significantly – paid for largely through extra taxes on businesses which proved highly controversial.\nBut she is now under pressure on several fronts. It emerged on Friday that government borrowing – the difference between its spending and its income from taxes – was even higher than expected in February.\nThe official prediction for that month from the Office for Budget Responsibility was £6.5 billion, but it hit £10.7bn, leaving the chancellor with less fiscal headroom. \nAdding to the Treasury's in-tray, official growth forecasts for the economy are also likely to be cut.\nLast week, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving £5bn a year by 2030 and creating a more \"pro-work system\", though ministers have not set out the breakdown of forecast savings.\nThe changes will affect people claiming disability and health benefits, as well as those aged under 22 relying on top-up payments while on universal credit.\nThe chancellor will set out the impact of these changes in more detail in her Spring Statement, and is expected to announce further cuts – this time to some Whitehall departments – to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.\nThe Treasury has reiterated that these rules – to not borrow for funding day-to-day public spending and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economy by 2029-30 - are \"non-negotiable\" .\n\"What I've done so far is put money into public services,\" Reeves insisted in her BBC interview.\nShe said there was \"real growth\" in spending for each of the next few years \"but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly\".\nBut Labour grandee Lord Blunkett wants Reeves to \"loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", calling them \"Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster on Saturday, the former work and pensions secretary under Tony Blair said he would \"raise the self-imposed rule by at least £10-15bn\" to help fund \"a new deal for the unemployed, getting half a million of those young people who are out of work and training into a job or a training programme\".\nReeves spoke to me earlier this week amid unease among Labour MPs at the welfare changes.\nIn the interview, she opened up on how the job is going so far following a number of controversies not only over her decisions, but also over the accuracy of parts of her CV.\nAsked whether she had been treated fairly, and in the same way as her male predecessors, Reeves told me: \"I think that would be up to others to judge and people to judge over time.\n\"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers' money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job.\n\"One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do.\"\nResponding to Reeves' comments on the economy, shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"The Labour chancellor promised 'growth, growth, growth' but since the Budget, growth is down, inflation is up, and business confidence has collapsed.\n\"Labour are having to come forward with an emergency Budget on Wednesday - a situation entirely of their own making.\n\"Rachel Reeves must urgently rethink her anti-business Budget.\"\nThe latest figures for the UK economy add pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Spring Statement next week.\nBorrowing costs had been widely expected to be left unchanged with inflation, predicted to go up in the coming months.\nInterest rates, set by the Bank of England, affect mortgage, loan and savings rates for millions.\nThe rate at which prices are rising remains above the Bank of England's 2% inflation target.\nThe government has set out plans to save billions of pounds from the welfare bill - how have previous attempts to do this fared? \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will present a Spring Statement next week focusing on fiscal responsibility, ruling out increased taxes or spending.  Despite higher-than-expected February borrowing (£10.7bn vs predicted £6.5bn) and anticipated economic growth forecast cuts, she maintains her commitment to reducing debt and not borrowing for day-to-day spending.  This involves planned cuts to government departments, following £5bn welfare reforms already announced.  However, this approach faces criticism from within the Labour party, with calls for more relaxed fiscal rules to boost employment. Reeves acknowledges the intense scrutiny she faces and defends her policies. The opposition criticizes her economic management, citing decreased growth and increased inflation.",

        "content": "George Foreman was a two-time heavyweight champion, winning his titles 21 years and nine months apart\nOne version of George Foreman had only mayonnaise sandwiches to eat at school. Another was winning Olympic gold aged 19. Another was committing muggings at 15.\nThe 20-something version of Foreman was one-third of heavyweight boxing's \"holy trinity\", with Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. The 45-year-old version would become boxing's oldest heavyweight world champion.\nHe was once marked to be another poor kid from Texas, lost to America's wasteland, but instead rose to be one of the most recognisable faces on the planet.\nForeman's powers of transformation served him well in a sporting career brimming with prestige and drama.\n'Big' George Foreman, who has died aged 76, leaves behind a professional legacy that many boxers today could only dream of replicating. He had 81 fights, 76 wins and just five losses.\nHe was twice the heavyweight champion of the world. He fought Frazier, Ken Norton and Ali. His longevity was such that he even faced a 28-year-old Evander Holyfield.\nHis legacy was forged in the Rumble in the Jungle, his haunting of Frazier and his impossible achievement aged 45.\nForeman secured his spot in the halls of heavyweight greatness many times over.\n\"I am sure he is in every argument for the greatest heavyweights of all time,\" 5 Live Boxing analyst Steve Bunce said.\n\"He had 76 wins and I don't often do stats and facts but 68 ended by knockout.\n\"I haven't done the research to tell you how many times he dropped men, but I will say of his 76 wins he probably dropped his opponent about 200 times in total.\n\"If Big George hit you, you stayed hit. It was as simple as that.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'A larger than life star' - Foreman dies age 76\nHeavyweight boxing legend Foreman dies aged 76\nForeman's life in pictures\nThe Rumble in the Jungle - 50 years on\nForeman was born in Marshall, Texas, 10 January 1949. He was one of six siblings and took the name of his stepfather, JD Foreman, rather than his birth father.\nBy his own admission, Foreman was a troubled kid struggling in an environment designed to keep him disenfranchised and angry.\nHe started mugging people by the age of 15.\n\"I've always been motivated by food, because I was always hungry,\" he said. \"There never was enough food to eat for me, for various reasons.\"\nHis mother, Nancy, convinced him to join the Job Corps aged 16. He earned his GED,, external and learned to be a carpenter and bricklayer, but in a pivotal moment for his life, he was introduced to boxing by a coach called Doc Broadus.\nForeman arrived at the 1968 Olympics aged 19 and with just 25 amateur fights under his belt. He bulldozed the competition, winning gold.\n\"Less than two years prior to the date that I'd stood on that platform receiving gold and listening to the national anthem, I was under a house, hiding from the police,\" he said later.\n\"I climbed from underneath that house, in mud and slop, and said to myself: 'I'm going to do something in my life, I'm not a thief.'\"\nRemembering George Foreman: The Rumble in the Jungle\nTributes pour in for heavyweight icon Foreman\nHear Foreman on This Sporting Life in 2020\nFrazier (left) was 29-0 when he met Foreman, who was 37-0\nForeman's Olympic triumph cleared a path into the pro ranks. He had 13 fights in his first year as a pro, with 11 knockouts. By 1972, he was 37-0 and the clear contender to the heavyweight champion Frazier.\nFrazier had beaten Ali. He was the top dog in the division. Foreman was a 4-1 underdog when they met in Kingston, Jamaica in January 1973.\nForeman knocked Frazier down six times in two rounds to become the WBA, WBC and lineal heavyweight champion.\nThe win completely altered the heavyweight landscape at the time. Foreman was only 24.\n\"That is the fight where he famously lifts Joe Frazier off the ground with an uppercut. That is George Foreman,\" Bunce said.\nForeman would say later Frazier was the only man he ever \"feared\" and how the victory changed his life overnight.\n\"One day you're no-one and the next day everyone wants to take advantage of you,\" he said.\nForeman was a big favourite against Muhammad Ali\nIt is hard to explain just how iconic the 'Rumble in the Jungle' is. If there was a room of statues representing the greatest fights, it would be there in the centre, along with the two seminal bouts between Ali and Frazier.\nIt was a fight that encapsulated everything boxing was, and still is. The sublime and the downright grime.\nIt was staged in Zaire on 30 October 1974, funded by the brutal dictatorship in control there at the time.\nAli, a massive underdog, had cast himself as the charismatic good guy and Foreman the brutish villain. It would be staged at 04:00 local time so some 50 million people could tune in across the world.\nA suspected 26 million people watched in the UK, out of a population of 56 million.\nForeman was expected to crush Ali. Instead Ali produced a classic performance, soaking up pressure for seven rounds. Debuting his 'rope-a-dope' style on the ropes, he slowly drained Foreman of his powers.\nIn the eighth round, Ali pounced. He dropped Foreman, who was not allowed to beat the count by the referee, thus bringing to a close one of the biggest upsets in world championship boxing.\nAfter his first loss in 41 fights, Foreman took two years out of the ring.\n\"From pride to pity, that was devastating,\" Foreman said of the loss.\nForeman complained the ropes had been loosened, that his trainer had even drugged him. He campaigned for a rematch but never got it. But once Ali called time on his career, he and Foreman became close friends.\nForeman famously helped a Parkinson-afflicted Ali climb the steps to receive an Oscar for the When We Were Kings documentary in 1996, which told the story of their showdown 22 years previously.\n\"Foreman was part of that holy trinity of heavyweight boxers, with Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier,\" boxing promoter Frank Warren said.\n\"The great fights they had between them were special times for boxing and world sport. \n\"They're events that have gone down not just in boxing, but significant moments in the world of sport.\"\nThis video can not be played\n Foreman relives the Rumble in the Jungle\nForeman had two impressive wins over fellow great Joe Frazier\nAt 27, Foreman got back in the ring to fight Frazier for a second time. They each received a $1m fight purse.\nOn 15 June 1976, Foreman crushed a 32-year-old Frazier for a second time, stopping him in the fifth.\nDuring the US TV broadcast, commentator Howard Cosell summed up the performance: \"George Foreman: Too big. Too strong. In perfect shape. The punches crisp from the very beginning.\"\nForeman was seemingly on top of the world again, though three fights later he would lose to Jimmy Young on points in a sluggish performance in Puerto Rico.\nAfter the fight, Foreman said he had a \"near-death experience\" in the dressing as he struggled with exhaustion and heatstroke. \nForeman said in that moment he became a believer in God. He retired from boxing aged 28 and became an ordained minister.\nForeman's famed punching power helped him achieve history at the age of 45\nTen years later, Foreman shocked the boxing world by announcing his comeback.\nHe returned initially because his George Foreman youth centre was in financial crisis but would rack up 24 wins between 1987 and 1991.\n\"Everybody laughed, and I listened to them laugh,\" Foreman told the BBC later. He faced Holyfield in April 1991 for the WBA, WBC and IBF heavyweight world titles.\nHolyfield would beat a 42-year-old Foreman, seemingly ending an impossible mission to become world champion again. \nHe tried again, losing on points to Tommy Morrison in 1993 - but was given the chance to fight WBA and IBF champion Michael Moorer next.\nWhen Foreman became world champion\nFellow American Moorer was cruising through the encounter before eating a right hand from Foreman in the 10th round.\nThe punch made Foreman the oldest heavyweight champion in history at 45.

He became a boxing analyst but to the younger generations he most known for his George Foreman grill.\nForeman had 12 children, naming all the boys George, and was married five times.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\nWomen's Six Nations: Bonar try gives Scotland three-point half-time lead over Wales\nWSL: Second-placed Arsenal host Liverpool looking to cut gap on Chelsea\nFrance survive red card to beat Ireland in Six Nations opener\nHow Nelli Cooman became the 60m fastest woman in the world\nTom Hanks guides you across the Americas\nEscape the noise of daily life with music and meditation\nThe very best bits from the hit comedy panel show\nKnight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?\n'If Big George hit you, you stayed hit' - Foreman obituary\nKnight sacked as England captain after Ashes thrashing\nFive talking points from Tuchel's first game as England boss\nThe Rumble in the Jungle, by those who witnessed it\nFirst impressions of 'low-key' Tuchel & his England team\nTuchel happy with start but England must be 'more dangerous' VideoTuchel happy with start but England must be 'more dangerous'\n'He does everything right' - the remarkable rise of Lewis-Skelly\nWhy England's 'warrior queen' is the perfect captain\nGroundbreaking but controversial - new IOC president Coventry\nYou can't write off Chelsea quadruple - Anita Asante\nWatch best of action as Scotland win in Greece.

        "summary": "George Foreman, a two-time heavyweight boxing champion, passed away at 76.  His career spanned decades, marked by both early struggles (including juvenile delinquency) and incredible triumphs.  He won Olympic gold, became the youngest heavyweight champion, and later, at age 45, the oldest.  His legendary fights included the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" against Muhammad Ali and multiple bouts against Joe Frazier.  Beyond boxing, Foreman was known for his entrepreneurial ventures (the George Foreman Grill) and faced later-in-life accusations of sexual abuse which he denied.",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump revoked security clearances from his previously defeated Democratic election rivals, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, as well as a number of other former officials and critics.\nTrump said in February he was revoking security clearance for his predecessor Joe Biden. His order confirmed that decision, adding that he was also revoking the security clearance of \"any other member\" of the Biden family. \n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump's memorandum read. \nFormer US presidents and top security officials usually keep their security clearance as a courtesy. \nTrump ordered department and agency leaders to \"revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities for these individuals.\"\n\"This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress,\" the order stated.\nFor several named figures, the loss of access to classified material and spaces will have a more symbolic impact. \nIt may limit the materials they are able to review, or restrict access to some government buildings or secure facilities.\nThe lawyers and prosecutors named by Trump, however, could potentially face roadblocks in accessing or reviewing information for their cases or clients.\nTrump's revocations focus on top Biden administration officials, as well as prominent political critics and attorneys who have challenged Trump or his allies in court.\nBiden's secretary of state Antony Blinken, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco all lost their clearances.\nTrump also targeted two of his own former officials from his first term: Fiona Hill and Alexander Vindman, who testified during his first impeachment trial that began in 2019.\nTrump also revoked access for high-profile Republican critics, former Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\nThey were the only two Republican lawmakers who joined a US House investigation into Trump's role in the 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.\nBoth also voted to charge Trump in his second impeachment, which a Democratic-led US House of Representatives instigated after the riot. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on the charge of inciting the 6 January riot.\nTrump has also singled out top legal opponents in his latest decision on security access. His order revoked clearance for New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought multiple lawsuits against Trump and his businesses. \nIn a civil fraud lawsuit that concluded in 2024, a judge found Trump liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. Trump is appealing the decision.\nManhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who prosecuted and won Trump's criminal hush money case last year, also lost his clearance.\nTrump's legal targets went beyond elected prosecutors. He withdrew security clearance for Norm Eisen, an attorney leading multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. \nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump during his first term and later provided media commentary about the hush money trial, also lost his clearance.\nPrevious media reports had indicated that the administration had pulled the security clearance for a top whistleblower attorney in Washington, Mark Zaid.\nFriday's order listed him among the individuals who would lose access. \nHowever, Mr Zaid told the BBC that \"despite being told three times that my clearance has been revoked, I still have not received anything formally.\"\nHe claimed losing his security clearance would harm \"the federal employees, including Trump supporters, who count on me to handle cases few other lawyers could.\"\nSeveral of the individuals chosen by Trump derided his order in social media statements.\n\"I don't care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn't been active for five years,\" Mr Vindman wrote on X.\nMr Eisen wrote on X that being targeted by Trump's order \"just makes me file even more lawsuits!\" \nTrump had earlier pulled security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials whom he accused of meddling in the 2020 election in Joe Biden's favour. He provided no evidence for these claims.\nIn February, Trump announced he was revoking Biden's security access. In a social media post, Trump said Biden \"set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents\".\nIn 2021, Biden - serving as president at the time - barred his defeated rival Trump from having access to intelligence briefings citing his \"erratic behaviour\".\nA 2024 Justice Department special counsel report found Biden had improperly retained classified documents from his time as vice president. The report noted that Biden had cooperated with federal investigators and returned the discovered documents.\nIn 2023, Justice Department special prosecutor Jack Smith indicted Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents following his first term in office and obstructing their return to the government.\nTrump pleaded not guilty and a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024. Smith officially dropped the case that December after Trump won re-election.\nThe shooting took place at a car meetup, police said. A 16-year-old was among those who died\nThe Trump administration has warned 60 universities funding may be cut if they do not address allegations of antisemitism on campuses.\nCubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who entered the US under a Biden-era programme face deportation. \nTrump said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. The reality is proving far more difficult. \nThe Chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning ahead of her announcements.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Several targeted individuals criticized the move, with some noting the action's symbolic nature or potential impact on their work.

        "published": "Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:41:59 GMT",
        "content": "Israel has carried out the most intense air strikes on Lebanon in nearly four months, after several rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel for the first time since a ceasefire came into effect in November.\nThe Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command centre belonging to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, in southern Lebanon.\nLebanon's health ministry said two people, including a child, were killed and eight injured in the strikes.\nSeveral armed groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Palestinian factions, and no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack. \nHezbollah, which is the most powerful of them, said it had no involvement, and that it remained committed to the ceasefire.\nSaturday's attack came days after Israel reinforced its offensive against Hamas, a Hezbollah ally, in Gaza.\nThe Israeli military said it had intercepted three rockets in the northern Israeli town of Metula, and there were no reports of casualties.\nThe Lebanese military said it had dismantled \"three primitive rocket launchers\" in the south, and the country's defence minister said an investigation had been launched into the attack.\nHezbollah, the main armed group active in Lebanon, said it had not carried out the attack, and that it remained committed to the ceasefire that ended 14 months of conflict in Lebanon.\nThis is the worst violence since the fragile ceasefire, brokered by the US and France, came into effect, ending more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\nUnder the terms of the deal, the Lebanese military would deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the south of the country to prevent armed groups from attacking Israel. \nHezbollah was required to remove its fighters and weapons, while the Israeli military would withdrawal from positions occupied in the war.\nBut Israel has carried out nearly daily air strikes on what it describes as Hezbollah targets, and has indicated that attacks will continue to prevent the group from rearming. \nThe Israeli military is still occupying five locations in southern Lebanon, in what the Lebanese government says is a violation of the country's sovereignty and a breach of the deal. \nIsrael says the Lebanese military has not yet fully deployed to those areas, and that it needs to remain at those points to guarantee the security of its border communities.\nSaturday's attack is another demonstration of the challenges facing the Lebanese army, as it tries to exert control over southern areas where Hezbollah has traditionally had a strong presence and support.\nLebanon's President Joseph Aoun, who came to power in January, has said only the state should have arms in the country, in what is seen as a reference to Hezbollah's arsenal. \nOn Saturday, he condemned \"attempts to drag Lebanon into a cycle of violence\", while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the escalation carried the \"risk of dragging the country into another war\".\nThe UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said it was \"alarmed by the possible escalation of violence\", urging both Israel and Lebanon to \"uphold their commitments\".\nHezbollah was battered in the conflict with Israel: many of its leaders were assassinated, hundreds of fighters killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. \nThe group faces the huge challenge of providing financial help to its communities affected by the war, and pressure from its opponents to disarm. \nLebanon's international partners say they will only help the country if the government acts to curb Hezbollah, the most powerful group in Lebanon.\nHezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. \nThe longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.\nThe offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents.\nIsrael's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border.\nThe defence minister says the IDF will increase the intensity of its operation in Gaza until Hamas releases hostages.\nBenjamin Netanyahu cited Shin Bet's failure to anticipate the 7 October attack - but the move sparked outrage and protests.\nA ballistic missile was fired toward Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, with sirens sounding in several areas of Israel.\nThe 51-year-old was injured in a blast which killed a UN worker, the charity he works for says.\nIsrael says troops have moved in up to the Netzarim Corridor, after two days of air strikes killed hundreds in Gaza.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "Israel launched its most intense air strikes on Lebanon in months after rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel.  Israel targeted Hezbollah infrastructure, killing two and injuring eight in Lebanon.  Hezbollah denied responsibility and reiterated its commitment to the November ceasefire.  This escalation follows recent Israeli offensives in Gaza. The incident highlights the fragility of the ceasefire and the challenges facing Lebanon in controlling its southern territories and Hezbollah's influence.  Both sides accuse each other of violating the ceasefire agreement. The UN expressed alarm and called for both sides to uphold their commitments.",

But the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) disagreed.\n\"Organisations must respect people's choices about how their data is used,\" a spokesperson for the ICO said. \"This means giving users a clear way to opt out of their data being used in this way.\"\nMs O'Carroll said that Meta had agreed to stop using her personal data for direct marketing purposes, \"which in non-legalese means I've essentially been able to turn off all the creepy, invasive, targeted ads on Facebook\".\nShe said that she did not want to stop using Facebook, saying that it is \"filled with all of those connections and family and friends, and entire chapters of my life\".\nMs O'Carroll said she hoped her individual settlement would make it easier for others who wanted Facebook to stop giving them targeted adverts.\n\"If other people want to exercise their right, I believe they now have a gateway to do so knowing that the UK regulator will back them up,\" she said.\nMeta said it disagreed with Ms O'Carroll's claims, adding \"no business can be mandated to give away its services for free.\"\nA spokesperson added: \"Facebook and Instagram cost a significant amount of money to build and maintain, and these services are free for British consumers because of personalised advertising.\"\n\"Our services support British jobs and economic growth by connecting businesses with the people most likely to buy their products, while enabling universal access to online services regardless of income. We will continue to defend its value while upholding user choice and privacy.\"\nFacebook and Instagram have a subscription service in most of Europe, where users can pay monthly so that they don't get ads on the platform.\nThe Meta spokesperson said the company was \"exploring the option\" of offering a similar service to UK users and would \"share further information in due course.\"\nSnag clothing is cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing models who appear \"unhealthily fat\" should be banned.\nSocial media company wins US emergency ruling preventing ex-director from publicising her book.\nSocial media company considered letting Beijing control content for access to its lucrative market, BBC told. \nThe investment firm will now be called aberdeen group as it hopes the name change will remove \"distractions\".\nPosing as an 18-year-old, BBC reporter Ruth Green quickly finds groups selling weapons openly.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "published": "Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:47:05 GMT",
        "content": "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage put on a brave face this week, as he sought to put a blazing row with one of the party's now suspended MPs behind him.\nThe party is still neck-and-neck with Labour in the polls, and on Monday, it showed off 29 councillors who had recently defected to Reform UK.\nWhile Farage acknowledged there had been \"a little bit of turbulence\", he stressed the upset was \"very much at the edges\".\nBut does the disquiet within the party go deeper than he suggested?\nDivisions have become more acute in a party that now boasts more than 200,000 members and 400 local branches across the country.\nMuch of the anger is directed at Farage and Reform's chairman, Zia Yusuf, over their efforts to professionalise the party.\nThe party is being more ruthless in its vetting of candidates. It's also investigating - and in some cases expelling - members because of their activity on social media.\nFarage is said to be desperate to avoid another election campaign where he faces constant questioning about the controversial comments of his candidates.\nBut as the party gears up for local elections in May, it faces a huge challenge to control unruly elements in its grassroots membership who resent the way they are being treated by the leadership.\nThe BBC has learned at least 12 interim chairs of local Reform UK branches have resigned over the conduct of the party's leadership in recent months.\nA Reform UK spokesman said the resignations amounted to 2% of its branch chairs.\n\"Our understanding is that the other parties have much higher churn than that,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We are sorry that we have lost 2% of our branch chairs, some of whom failed vetting. But we're the only major party that does this sort of vetting.\"\nOne of the chairs was Maria Bowtell, a councillor on East Riding of Yorkshire Council who gave a speech at Reform UK's party conference last year.\nIn her resignation letter, she said she felt \"abandoned\" in her role, described the party's candidate selection as \"chaotic\", and accused the leadership of lacking integrity.\nOther members have quit on free-speech grounds, including Howard Cox, who stood as a Reform UK candidate in the general election and the London mayoral poll.\nHe said he left the party after he was threatened with expulsion for criticising the treatment of Tommy Robinson, a prominent far-right activist.\nCox told the BBC \"my inboxes are now flooded with grassroots Reformers who are incredibly upset and feel that their political optimism for our country has been betrayed\".\n\"Over a dozen Reform branches have contacted me, stating that they have been replaced, overridden, and disrespected by Zia Yusuf's headquarters team,\" he added.\nOther branch chairs resigned over policy differences, particularly the issue of \"mass deportations\", which Farage has called a \"political impossibility\".\nJack Davison, the former chair of the Dover and Deal branch, said in attempting to professionalise, the party was adopting the \"very traits of the establishment it sought to challenge\".\n\"This culture of 'silencing' was deeply troubling,\" he said.\nAnother former branch chair in Newcastle, Dan Astley, said the party had not been \"properly democratised\".\nHe said the Reform UK's constitution, which was adopted last year, allowed the party's board to have the final say on sacking and appointing a new leader.\nBut for many already disgruntled members, the allegations against Rupert Lowe have infuriated and disillusioned them the most.\nThe MP was been suspended by Reform UK over accusations of bullying in his office, and a police investigation into alleged threats against the party's chairman, Yusuf.\nLowe has denied any wrongdoing and his supporters have rallied around him, accusing the leadership of trying to force him out for daring to challenge Farage.\nThe row came as no surprise to Ben Habib, a former Reform UK deputy leader who quit the party citing \"fundamental differences\" with Farage.\nHe told the BBC that Farage's idea of professionalisation \"would appear to be the wilful destruction of the grassroots movement\".\n\"The playbook used against Rupert Lowe has been used across the grassroots,\" he said.\nThe BBC put some of these criticisms to the party's chairman, Yusuf.\nHe said Reform UK under Farage had delivered \"the greatest political acceleration in British history\", with \"a fraction of the resources of the two old parties\".\nYusuf, who was appointed chairman after the general election last year, said the party had vetted thousands of people and \"the majority have passed\".\nBut some don't, he said, adding that \"just comes with the territory of being a professional party\".\nReform UK's vetting system, Yusuf said, was \"meaningfully more rigorous than anything that the other parties do\".\n\"Of course, anything growing at this scale, there'll be some teething issues,\" he added.\nThe recent ructions do appear to have cut through to the voting public though.\nOne recent survey suggested that the party was split with a third of Reform voters believing the party would be faring better under a different leader, but the same amount believing that the party would be doing worse. \nThe survey also suggested that Farage's net favourability with Reform voters had fallen since the Lowe row.\nYet the latest YouGov poll put Reform UK on 23% of the vote, behind Labour on 24% but ahead of the Conservatives on 22%.\nGawain Towler still believes in Farage's leadership, despite being sacked as Reform UK's head of press last year.\nTowler said he had been to several branch meetings as a speaker recently and had witnessed very little dissent.\nHe said Reform UK won 4.1 million votes at last year's general election \"with a ramshackle operation and an army of volunteers who worked their socks off for no recompense whatsoever\".\n\"We need to get at least 10 million to win,\" Towler said. \"You're not going to find six million votes to our right. You'd be mad to appease some screamy people on the outside of the party.\"\nFor now, the party's focus is trained on the upcoming local elections. It has high hopes in Lincolnshire where its candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory MP, is vying to be mayor.\nReform UK sources say internal private polling has left them optimistic about winning what would be its highest elected office to date.\nBut to become a serious contender to win a general election, Reform UK may have to get a firmer grip on its grassroots.\nIt may also have to convince members to back some of the messy compromises that other mainstream parties make to attract more voters.\nDaniel Turner has admitted defrauding the Meridale Youth and Community Centre in Sutton-on-Sea.\nStephen Atkinson says he is resigning from his position as council leader after six years.\nA Reform politician in Essex says the suspension of Rupert Lowe is a \"Westminster bubble story\".\nNathan Gill appears at the Old Bailey charged with nine counts related to alleged bribery. \nAfter more than a decade with the Conservatives, councillor Vernon Smith will stand for Reform.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, is experiencing internal strife despite strong poll numbers.  Resentment towards Farage and Chairman Zia Yusuf's efforts to professionalize the party, including stricter candidate vetting and social media monitoring, has led to numerous resignations of local branch chairs and members.  These departures stem from accusations of silencing dissent, chaotic candidate selection, and policy disagreements, particularly regarding mass deportations. While the party downplays the issue, the internal conflict has impacted Farage's favorability and raises questions about the party's ability to manage its growth and maintain grassroots support.  Despite the challenges, Reform UK remains optimistic about upcoming local elections.",

        "content": "For most people, the idea of a holiday abroad involves packing a suitcase and being away for at least a weekend, if not a week or more.\nBut for Monica Stott, a single day is enough to fly to another country, explore, and return home before bedtime. \nThe 37-year-old from Wrexham enjoys taking part in holidays that have become known online as extreme day trips - and has visited Milan, Bergamo, Lisbon, Amsterdam and even Reykjavik for a single day.\n\"I think people are always surprised that you really do feel like you've had a holiday,\" said Monica.\nMonica, who is a full-time travel blogger, said the idea of an extreme day trip first occurred to her while travelling for work. \n\"My first few extreme day trips were to Ireland when I had clients over there,\" she explained. \n\"I'd quite often pop over for a one or two-hour meeting and come home. Then I realised I could stay [a bit longer] and make a full day of it.\"\nMonica then discovered a number of Facebook groups where people were sharing their own experiences of extreme day trips, and became inspired to start booking her own in her spare time.\n\"There's research suggesting that most of your best holiday memories are made in the first one or two days. When I thought about it, I agreed. A lot of the best moments happen when you first arrive.\n\"You arrive in time for breakfast, squeeze as much as you possibly can, and then fly home at night. It's an intense, busy, crazy day.\" \nWhile Monica enjoys busy days in one location, Luka Chijiutomi-Ghosh, an 18-year-old student from Cardiff, has taken things a step further.\n\"It began on Christmas Eve when I found a return flight to Prague for under £15. I booked it immediately, but then I realised the flight landed in Prague at 21:00 and returned to the UK at 09:00,\" said Luka.\n\"So, I thought I could treat it as if it was daytime, sleep in the day and walk around the city at night.\"\nLuka said he realised that he only needed six hours to explore a city. \nA few weeks later, when on holiday in Paris, he decided to see how many neighbouring countries he could travel to within a day by train.\n\"I went to Luxembourg, Brussels and Amsterdam, and returned to Paris all within the same day,\" he said.\nLuka's logic, he said, was that he would probably have spent as much time travelling if he was on a day trip in the UK.\nFacebook groups where people share their experiences of taking extreme day trips have acquired hundreds of thousands of members, with some focused specifically on regional UK airports.\nMonica and Luka said their trips were efficient, budget-friendly, and helped to break up their routines without needing a week away from home. \n\"People always say they'd love to visit places like Paris or Rome but don't have the time or money for a long trip. This is a way around that,\" Monica said.\nFor Luka, it's also a practical choice. \n\"I look at how much I spend on a student night out, sometimes up to £60 or £70. If I can get a return flight for under £20 and experience a whole new city instead, why not?\"\nDespite Monika and Luka's enthusiasm, extreme day trips have drawn criticism over their environmental impact. \nFlying is responsible for 2.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 8% of UK emissions. \nThese gases warm the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change.\nBoth Monica and Luka acknowledge this issue.\n\"I think if it means people are taking way more flights, and airlines are putting on more flights, then I do see that as a negative impact,\" Monica said. \n\"But a lot of people doing extreme day trips are doing it because they either can't afford to take a longer holiday or don't have time. \n\"I don't think it's fair to say one person's holiday is more important than another person's holiday, because they're going for longer.\"\nLuka argued that the flights would often go ahead regardless. \n\"The seat will be filled by someone,\" he said.\n\"Also, if another form of transport can be used then that would be a good idea. For example, on my trip involving three cities, I didn't take a single flight.\" \nBoth also said that extreme day trips were appealing due to the high cost of public transport within the UK. \nMonica said her trips required careful planning.\n\"I try to choose destinations that are less than a two-hour flight. Once you get in over two hours, it's just such a long day of travel.\"\nShe also said she tried to stay calm at the airport to avoid unnecessary stress. \n\"A lot of people get really excited or anxious at the airport, and that can be exhausting,\" she said.\n\"If you just treat it like getting on a train or a bus, you don't use up all your energy with that pre-holiday anxiety.\"\nTanya O'Carroll says her case opens a \"gateway\" for others wanting to stop personalised adverts.\nMonica Stott has embraced \"extreme day trips\" where people go abroad and return home before bed.\nBritish boy band Five will kick off their reunion tour in the Welsh capital after a 25 year hiatus.\nCardiff move up fifth in the United Rugby Championship on head coach Matt Sherratt's return from the Wales interim job.\nBBC Verify's Nick Beake explains how Europe's busiest airport was taken out of action.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

This was an escalation on his previous commitment in May 2023 to stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.\nTrump has now been in office for more than two months and the penny may be beginning to drop in the White House that trying to end a conflict as bitter and complex as this may take time.\nIn a television interview last weekend, the US president admitted that when he promised to end the war in a day, he was \"being a little bit sarcastic\".\nThere are many reasons for the slower progress than Team Trump may have anticipated.\nFirst, the president's belief in the power of his personal, one-on-one diplomacy may have been misplaced. He has long believed any international problem can be solved if he sits down with another leader and agrees a deal. Trump first spoke to Vladimir Putin on 12 February, an hour-and-a-half conversation he described as \"highly productive\". The two leaders spoke again on 18 March. \nBut it is clear these telephone calls failed to secure the immediate 30-day interim ceasefire Trump wanted. The only substantive concession he squeezed out of Putin was a promise to end Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, a commitment he is accused by Ukraine of breaking within hours of the call.\nSecond, the Russian president has made it clear he does not intend to be rushed. His first public comments about the negotiations came last week in a press conference that was a whole month after his telephone call with Trump. \nPutin showed he was resolutely opposed to the US two-stage strategy of seeking an interim ceasefire before talking about a longer-term settlement. Instead, he said any talks must address what he sees as \"the root causes of the war\", namely his fears an expanding Nato alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state somehow present a threat to Russia's security. He also set out detailed questions and conditions that must be answered and met before any deal could be agreed.\nThird, the US strategy of directing its initial focus on Ukraine may have been misjudged. The White House came to the belief that President Zelensky was the obstacle to peace. Western diplomats acknowledge the Ukrainian government was slow to realise just how much the world had changed with the arrival of Trump. \nBut the US pressure on Kyiv that led to the now infamous confrontation in the Oval Office - when Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, harangued the Ukrainian leader - consumed time, effort and political capital. \nIt also ruptured transatlantic relations, setting Europe and the US at odds, another diplomatic problem that took time to settle. All the while Vladimir Putin sat back and enjoyed the show, biding his time.\nFourth, the sheer complexity of the conflict makes any resolution hard. The Ukrainian offer was initially for an interim ceasefire in the air and at sea. The idea was that this would be relatively straightforward to monitor. \nBut in last week's talks in Jeddah, the US insisted any immediate ceasefire should also include the more than 1200km-long front line in the east. Instantly that made the logistics of verifying any ceasefire more complicated. This, of course, was then rejected by Putin.\nBut even his agreement to the more modest proposal - to end attacks on energy infrastructure - is not without its problems. It is the details about that proposal which will occupy much of the technical negotiations that are expected to take place in Saudi Arabia on Monday. Military and energy experts will draw up detailed lists of potential power plants – nuclear or otherwise – that might be protected. \nThey will also try to agree which weapons systems should not be used. But agreeing the difference between energy and other civilian infrastructure may take some time. Remember: Ukraine and Russia are not talking to one another; they are engaging separately and bilaterally with the US which is promising to shuttle between both sides. This again adds to the time.\nFifth, the US focus on the economic benefits of a ceasefire distracted attention from the priority of ending the fighting. Trump has spent time trying to agree a framework deal giving US firms access to Ukrainian critical minerals. Some saw this as the US investing in Ukraine's future - others as it extorting the country's natural resources.\nPresident Zelensky argued initially he could agree a deal only if the US promised to provide Ukraine with security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. The White House refused, saying the presence of US mining firms and workers would be deterrent enough. Eventually Zelensky conceded defeat and said he would agree a minerals deal without security guarantees. But despite that, the US has yet to sign the agreement, hoping again to improve the terms, possibly by including access to or even ownership of Ukrainian nuclear power plants.\nEnding wars can be complex and time consuming. We would not have got to this stage without Trump's pushing, but progress has not been as quick or simple as he believed. In December 2018, as he campaigned for the presidency, Volodymyr Zelensky suggested negotiations with Vladimir Putin would be quite straightforward. \"You need to talk in a very simple way,\" he told the Ukrainian journalist, Dmytro Gordon. '\"What do you want, what are your conditions?\" And I'd tell them: 'Here are our points.' We would agree somewhere in the middle.\"\nWell, on the evidence of the last two months, it may be harder than that.\nThe US president also confirmed he was revoking the security clearance of Joe Biden and \"any other member\" of the Biden family. \nBen Hurst says he wants to teach children \"essential skills\" so they can rebuild their country. \nThe Trump administration has warned 60 universities funding may be cut if they do not address allegations of antisemitism on campuses.\nCubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who entered the US under a Biden-era programme face deportation. \nThe Chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning ahead of her announcements.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "Donald Trump's initial promise to quickly end the Ukraine war proved overly optimistic.  His belief in personal diplomacy,  misjudged strategies (pressuring Zelensky, prioritizing economic benefits over ending fighting), and the conflict's inherent complexity all contributed to slower-than-expected progress.  Despite phone calls with Putin, a swift resolution remains elusive due to Putin's unyielding stance and the intricacies of negotiating a ceasefire across multiple fronts.  The article also mentions unrelated news items about Trump revoking Biden family security clearances, a focus on children's skills development, warnings to universities about antisemitism, deportations, and the Chancellor's cautious economic approach.",

                "Answer": "Trump's initial optimism stemmed from his belief in the power of personal diplomacy and his simplistic view of the conflict. This proved unrealistic due to the conflict's inherent complexity, Putin's unwillingness to compromise quickly, and the misjudged US strategies that prioritized economic gains and pressured Ukraine, creating further complications."

                "Question": "Discuss the differing approaches of Trump and Putin regarding the negotiation strategy.",
                "Answer": "Trump favored a two-stage approach: an immediate ceasefire followed by broader negotiations. Putin insisted on addressing the \"root causes\" of the conflict – his concerns about NATO expansion and Ukraine's sovereignty – before considering any ceasefire. This fundamental disagreement hindered progress."

                "Answer": "US pressure on Zelensky, including the tense Oval Office confrontation, consumed valuable time and resources, damaged transatlantic relations, and ultimately didn't achieve its intended goal of securing a quick peace deal.  It played into Putin's hands, allowing him to wait for a more advantageous situation."

                "Question": "Explain the challenges associated with verifying a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict.",
                "Answer": "Verifying a ceasefire in Ukraine is complex due to the extensive frontline, the range of weaponry used, and the difficulty of distinguishing between military and civilian targets, especially regarding energy infrastructure.  The lack of direct communication between Russia and Ukraine, with the US acting as a go-between, adds to the logistical hurdles."

                "Answer": "The US focus on securing access to Ukrainian critical minerals for its firms created divisions.  While some viewed this as a forward-looking investment in Ukraine's future, others criticized it as an attempt to exploit the country's resources. This secondary focus detracted from the priority of ending the fighting."

                "Answer": "Zelensky initially believed negotiations would be straightforward, involving a simple exchange of demands and a compromise in the middle. Reality proved far more complex, highlighting the difficulty of resolving a deeply entrenched conflict with a determined adversary."

            {
                "Question": "What were some of the key miscalculations made by the Trump administration in its approach to the Ukraine conflict?",
                "Answer": "Key miscalculations included overestimating the power of personal diplomacy, underestimating the complexity of the conflict, misjudging the sequencing of negotiations (prioritizing economic gains over ceasefire), and alienating European allies through aggressive pressure on Ukraine."

                "Question": "Describe the communication dynamics between the US, Ukraine, and Russia.",
                "Answer": "The US acted as an intermediary shuttling between Ukraine and Russia, as the two countries weren't engaging directly.  This indirect communication, coupled with the differing priorities and approaches of all three parties, added to the complexity of the negotiations and the time it took to achieve even limited progress."

                "Answer": "The article portrays the pace of progress as far slower and the success as far more limited than Trump initially promised or predicted. While Trump's involvement was a key element, the complex nature of the conflict, the stances of the other parties involved, and the various internal and external factors created a much more challenging situation than anticipated."
