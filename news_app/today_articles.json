        "content": "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs – which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)\nThey are set to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\nThere are a number of events and activities happening across the region to keep children busy.\nAfter decades of close ties, what happens to Gaza could put Egypt-US friendship at risk.\nThousands were killed in Lebanon during Israel's most recent conflict with Hezbollah.\nThe BBC hears from the parents of four young women who were taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and held for 15 months.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:03:21 GMT",
        "content": "US Vice-President JD Vance has launched a scalding attack on European democracies, saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nIt had been expected that Vance would use his speech at the Munich Security Conference to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"not acceptable\".\nVance repeated the Trump administration's line that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\".\nThe Ukraine war was mentioned, with Vance saying he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached, after US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement earlier this week that he and Russia's Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin peace talks.\nBut Vance's address otherwise focused on culture-war issues and key themes of Trump's campaign for the US presidency - a departure from the usual security and defence discussions at the annual conference.\nHe alleged European Union \"commissars\" were suppressing free speech, blamed the continent for mass migration, and accused its leaders of retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as \"trying to pick a fight\" with Europe, home to some of the US's closest allies.\nMichael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told Politico Vance's remarks were \"insulting\" and \"just empirically not true\".\nVance used his 20-minute speech to single out several European nations, including the UK.\nHe raised a legal case in which an army veteran who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic was convicted of breaching an 150-metre safe zone around the centre.\nThe safe zone, introduced in October 2022, bans activity in favour or against abortion services, including protests, harassment and vigils.\nBut Vance argued that the \"basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular\" were under threat.\nVance went on to criticise the use of laws enforcing buffer zones, saying that free speech was in retreat and alleging that the Scottish government had warned people against private prayer within their own homes.\nIn response, the Scottish government said Vance's claim was \"incorrect\" and the law was \"carefully drafted to capture only intentional or reckless behaviour close to a small number of premises providing abortion services\".\nNine days before a tense national election in Germany, he touched on a heated debate in the country around mainstream political parties maintaining a so-called \"firewall\" of non-cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIn the decades since democracy was restored in Germany after the defeat of the Nazis, there has been a consensus among its main political parties not to work with far-right parties.\n\"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\" Vance said. \"There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, later shared parts of his speech on X, praising it as \"excellent\". The two reportedly met afterwards, according to German public broadcaster ZDF.\nIn his own speech, Pistorius directly addressed Vance, saying: \"Democracy was called into question by the US vice-president for the whole of Europe.\n\"He speaks of the annihilation of democracy,\" Pistorius continued. \"And if I have understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes... that is not acceptable.\"\nVance also made reference to the presidential election in Romania, which was annulled in December after declassified documents suggested it had been targeted by Russian state interference.\nVance told the conference: \"If your democracy can be destroyed with a few $100,000 of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with.\"\nRomanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said his country remains \"a defender of the democratic values that Europe shares with the USA\". \n\"All RO [Romanian] authorities are committed to organising free and fair elections by empowering citizens and guaranteeing the freedom to vote,\" he wrote on X.\nVance later met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the conference, which has otherwise mainly focussed on Russia's full-scale invasion.\nZelensky said during the meeting that more work was needed on planning to end the fighting, while Vance said the pair shared a \"fruitful\" conversation.\nTrump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich, but Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the summit.\nLord Dannatt says up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and \"we just haven't got that number available\".\nInstead, US Vice President JD Vance shocked delegates by roundly attacking Washington's allies, accusing them of censorship.\nDonald Trump's phone call with Putin has shocked both Ukraine's president Zelensky and allies alike, but is it enough to start peace talks?\nThere has been no increase in radiation levels at the plant, Ukraine's president says.\nThe inside story of Jamal Musiala's historic new contract at Bayern Munich, which ties down one of the most exciting midfielders in the world.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91kgv8v1lo",
        "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:33:51 GMT",
        "content": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequiès, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, Bénédicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died – I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

I walked out and the visibility was awful.\n\"I did not expect it to be so bad, especially seeing the embers coming from the window at the top, because it was so dark you can just see the orange glow and [the firefighters] were really trying to fight it with the water jets.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "content": "This year's Munich Security Conference (MSC) was supposed to be primarily about two things: how to end the war in Ukraine without giving in to Russia, and how Europe needed to boost its spending on defence.\nBut the most senior American present, US Vice President JD Vance, used his time at the podium to talk about neither.\nInstead, he shocked delegates on Friday by roundly attacking Washington's allies, including Britain, in a blistering attack decrying misinformation, disinformation, and the rights of free speech.\nIt was a very weird 20 minutes - one met largely with silence from delegates in the hall.\nEven a joke, \"if American democracy can survive 10 years of [climate campaigner] Greta Thunberg scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk\", failed to raise a single laugh.\nHe accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nVance's speech went down very badly - unequivocally badly. It was extraordinarily poorly judged.\nBut who was it aimed at? \nA US commentator said to me afterwards: \"That was all for US domestic consumption.\"\nThe vice president did, however, go on to meet the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who did his best to sound positive.\nThe pair had \"a good conversation\", according to Zelensky, who said it marked \"our first meeting, not last, I'm sure\". The Ukrainian leader emphasised the need for Washington and Kyiv to speak more and work together \"to prepare the plan [on] how to stop Putin and finish the war\".\n\"We want, really, we want peace very much. But we need real security guarantees,\" Zelensky added.\nAccording to US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin also wants peace, but that is peace on his terms. Unless those have secretly changed,  they involve capitulation to Russia's demands and the permanent ceding of territory to Moscow.\nVance's speech came days after President Trump effectively pulled the rug out from Ukraine's negotiating position by conceding, via his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, that restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".\nThe US also dashed Kyiv's hopes of joining Nato, a key ambition of President Zelensky, and ruled out sending US troops to help protect Ukraine's borders from the next time Russia decides to invade.\nAhead of the Munich conference Europe was stunned by news that Trump had held an apparently cordial 90-minute phone call with Putin, thus abruptly ending the West's three-year freeze in talking to the Russian leader that has been in place since the time of the 2022 invasion.\nThe delegates in Munich are scheduled to focus on the war in Ukraine in a high-profile debate on Saturday.\nThe fear in Munich amongst European leaders and their delegations is that in Donald Trump's rush to secure a peace deal in Ukraine, Putin will emerge victorious, stronger and planning to seize more parcels of land in Europe.\nThe vice-president's speech at the Munich Security Conference was denounced by several European leaders.\nDespite a US waiver allowing the resumption of humanitarian help, life-saving services have shut.\nYou'll sometimes see one of his children on his shoulders as billionaire Elon Musk makes public appearances. \nAn anonymous accuser who alleged the two rappers had assaulted her when she was 13 has withdrawn her civil claim.\nAn order to halt the pursuit of bribery and fraud charges against Adams prompted the resignation of seven career US attorneys.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "US Vice President JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference unexpectedly criticized US allies, focusing on domestic issues rather than the war in Ukraine or European defense spending.  This was poorly received.  Meanwhile,  President Trump's actions, including a phone call with Putin and downplaying Ukraine's territorial claims, raised concerns among European leaders about a potential unfavorable peace deal that could benefit Russia.  Zelensky, despite meeting Vance, emphasized the need for continued US support and security guarantees.  The conference is expected to heavily focus on the ongoing Ukrainian conflict.",

        "content": "Elon Musk's children have been to places many will never see.\nFrom meetings with foreign leaders to the control room of a SpaceX launch, Musk's children have debuted as constant sidekicks to their father's endeavors in tech, business and now, politics.\nThey have made frequent appearances in the nation's capital since President Donald Trump tapped the tech billionaire and Tesla co-founder to lead the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency.\nMusk's four-year-old, \"Lil X\", hung on the corner of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday sporting a tan pea coat and a collared shirt.\nOn Thursday, X and two of his siblings exchanged gifts with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while their father discussed technology and innovation with the foreign leader.\nMusk has frequently been seen with his children even before coming to Washington - at a meeting with the president of Turkey, a memorial service at Auschwitz concentration camp, and a Time magazine ceremony where he was named the 2021 person of the year.\nBut why do Musk's children tag along?\n\"The inclusion of the kids in many public appearances is very much a politician move or a political move to make him seem a bit more personable (and) take a human approach to how the public views him,\" says Kurt Braddock, an American University professor of public communication.\nStill, Mr Braddock thought the decision to bring Musk's preschooler to the Oval Office was unusual.\nX appeared bored during the 30-minute press briefing as he mimicked his father, sat on the floor and received the occasional side glance and smile from the leader of the free world. At one point, it appeared he told someone in the room to \"shush\" their mouth.\nMr Braddock said he believes their inclusion is intentional - a distraction that benefits both Musk and Trump.\n\"I do think that there is a bit of a strategy here trying to draw attention to some things while diverting attention to other things,\" he said.\nJon Haber, a strategic communication consultant who has worked with five presidential campaigns and teaches at Harvard, said Musk's children making frequent appearances - and creating viral moments - is beneficial for Trump.\n\"For Trump, the more chaos, the more he floods the zone, the less anybody can really focus on. Chaos works for him,\" Mr Haber said.\nGrimes, Musk's ex-girlfriend and the mother of X, criticised her son's appearance in the Oval Office.\n\"He should not be in public like this,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"I did not see this… but I'm glad he was polite. Sigh.\"\nIn a 2022 Vanity Fair article, she said that she wasn't a fan of her son being in the spotlight.\n\"Whatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it, and X is just out there. I mean, I think E is really seeing him as a protégé and bringing him to everything and stuff.… X is out there. His situation is like that. But, yeah, I don't know.\"\nLong before politics, Musk allowed his children to tag along. \nA decade ago, when he was still building his profile and eager to draw attention to his electric-vehicle maker Tesla, it wasn't unusual to see them at events.\nAs analysts and reporters waited for one unveiling to begin at a Tesla facility in Silicon Valley in 2015, his five children could be seen running through the hallways chasing after each other and shrieking with laughter.\nDespite being forced to wait for hours for attendees, the presence of Musk's children created an atmosphere that felt relaxed and even joyous.\nIt was a departure from the stiff, far more formal events held by other companies for which the prospect of seeing an executive's very young children would have come across as odd.\nMusk has had 12 children with three different women.\nHis most-recognised son, X Æ A-12?, goes by \"Lil X\", the same letter Musk used to re-name Twitter when he purchased the social media company.\nThe four-year-old has been dubbed an \"emotional support human\" by Musk himself.\nWalter Isaacson, the author of Musk's biography, said on The Diary of a CEO podcast that Musk is \"deeply committed\" to his children and is \"almost obsessed by them\".\n\"With his own children, his lovers, his wives, there is the same intensity that is baked into everything he does,\" Mr Isaacson said.\n\"He always likes having some of his children around him. He always likes having a companion, but that doesn't mean that he likes calmness.\"\nInstead, US Vice President JD Vance shocked delegates by roundly attacking Washington's allies, accusing them of censorship.\nDespite a US waiver allowing the resumption of humanitarian help, life-saving services have shut.\nAn anonymous accuser who alleged the two rappers had assaulted her when she was 13 has withdrawn her civil claim.\nAn order to halt the pursuit of bribery and fraud charges against Adams prompted the resignation of seven career US attorneys.\nProsecutors claim New York's mayor accepted opulent hotel stays and donations from Turkish citizens. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "content": "It's the early hours of the morning in March 2024 and Ben is woken by shouting and swearing. It's aimed at him, and he says it feels threatening. It's the woman who lives in the flat below.\nAn hour before, Ben could see and hear threats on the screen of his doorbell camera. It's been rung multiple times and he says he's barely slept.\nThis is the 78th incident on a meticulous log Ben has been keeping since the anti-social behaviour started about a year before.\nHe says he's been \"abused\" and \"physically threatened that we would be shot, stabbed and have our knees broken if we leave the house\". He says he now lives in a constant state of fear.\nBen bought the ex-council flat in Wandsworth almost three years ago and around six months later, Drina Gray moved into the flat below. He says the issues began soon after.\nAs well as threats, he says he and his girlfriend Emma are plagued by noise from her flat below, including the tenant's dogs barking, music, shouting and vacuuming all through the night.\nHe says the disruption even affected his ability to work.\n\"Because I was so sleep-deprived, I was getting to work quite late. I couldn't focus on my job. Ultimately due to just so much stress, so much anxiety, I lost my job.\"\nBen eventually got a new job but says he's been left feeling \"really helpless\" and says the whole experience has had a detrimental impact on his mental health.\nEmma adds that she too has been left \"terrified\".\n\"We just feel trapped,\" she says.\nBen and Emma are not alone in experiencing anti-social behaviour. According to the latest official data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 36% of people experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour last year, up from 34% the previous year.\nBen is a leaseholder in a council-owned block and says many of his complaints to Wandsworth Council went unanswered.\nHe says he feels ignored, despite mentioning concerns about mental health and violent threats.\nBen and Emma have called the police to their address more than 20 times and say while local neighbourhood officers have been helpful, they feel failed by the system and \"let down\" by response times when they call 999.\nIn August, an official review panel - made up of police and public officials - found there had \"not been good communication between agencies\" and \"none of the agencies has taken ownership of the case\".\nWandsworth council has accepted it \"could have acted more swiftly.\"\nBen has now complained to the housing ombudsman.\nOver the last year, across the UK, the Housing Ombudsman has ruled that of the 809 anti-social behaviour cases he has presided over, 67% of social landlords hadn't dealt with the issue to an adequate standard.\nRichard Blakeway, the Housing Ombudsman, said: \"Anti-social behaviour can cause unimaginable distress to people, have a profound impact on the community, and be complex for landlords to manage.\"\nHe added that he repeatedly sees cases where \"failures prolong issues and leaves residents feeling unheard and continuing to suffer\".\nThe BBC showed some of Ben's footage to Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales.\n\"It shows that the system isn't working, once again, to protect innocent people,\" she says.\nBaroness Newlove's husband Garry died in hospital after being attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, in August 2007 by three youths after he went to speak to a gang he believed had been vandalising his wife's car.\nShe says 17 years later, agencies still don't understand the impact anti-social behaviour has on victims. She fears it will take another death for it to be taken more seriously and for it not be treated as \"low-level\" crime.\nShe says her inbox is full of complaints from victims about anti-social behaviour.\nBaroness Newlove hopes new powers in the Crime and Policing Bill, being drafted this year, will improve protection for victims.\nIn December, Ben's neighbour, Drina Gray, pleaded guilty to charges including harassment and criminal damage and will be sentenced in March.\nBen says the anti-social behaviour has continued and Gray has been rearrested multiple times since. She returned to the flat after the first arrest but the BBC understands she is temporarily staying elsewhere as per her bail conditions. \nThe council says following the court case, it is now seeking possession of the property.\nBut Ben says he has no idea when Gray will be permanently moved.\nIn a statement, Wandsworth Council said it \"takes criminal and anti-social behaviour very seriously, and we work with partners to both support residents and to take the appropriate action against those responsible. \n\"This is a complex case where housing officers have been working closely with a number of different agencies, including the Police, to resolve the matter.\"\nA spokesperson for the Met Police said: \"Any form of anti-social behaviour is taken seriously and we work in partnership with local authority colleagues to ensure that issues raised are addressed\".\nAddressing Ben and Emma's specific case, the spokesperson said the police were working to \"ensure that the offender is brought before the courts when there is evidence to support it\". \nThe BBC contacted Drina Gray for comment. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "Ben and Emma, leaseholders in a Wandsworth council flat, endured a year of relentless anti-social behavior from their neighbor, Drina Gray, including threats, noise, and harassment.  Despite numerous police calls (over 20) and complaints to the council, the response was inadequate, leaving the couple feeling helpless and impacting their mental health and employment. An official review highlighted poor inter-agency communication.  Gray has been arrested multiple times, pleaded guilty to harassment and criminal damage, and the council is seeking possession of her flat.  The case highlights systemic failures in addressing anti-social behavior, echoing concerns raised by the victims' commissioner, Baroness Newlove, who emphasizes the need for improved protection and response.",
