        "content": "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.\nBut at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.\nAs a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.\nMoments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.\nSeveral of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.\n\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.\nZakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.\nIt's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.\nTo gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.\nYousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.\nWe focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.\nMore than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\nBy and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.\nWe wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.\nAbdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.\nRenad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.\nWe also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.\nSome of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.\nThat's where we found Zakaria.\nEveryone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.\nSometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.\nWhen there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.\nThere is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.\nThere were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.\nAs much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.\nZakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.\nOther staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.\nIn recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs – which he takes great pride in.\nSaid tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.\nSitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".\nBut Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.\nZakaria is himself looking beyond childhood.\n\"I want to be a paramedic,\" he says. \"But first I need to get out of here.\"\nAs told to George Sandeman\nWatch - Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone is on BBC Two and iPlayer at 21:00 on 17 February (UK-only)\nThey are set to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\nThere are a number of events and activities happening across the region to keep children busy.\nAfter decades of close ties, what happens to Gaza could put Egypt-US friendship at risk.\nThousands were killed in Lebanon during Israel's most recent conflict with Hezbollah.\nThe BBC hears from the parents of four young women who were taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and held for 15 months.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "Eleven-year-old Zakaria, a volunteer at a Gaza hospital, has witnessed thousands of bodies due to the ongoing conflict.  The BBC documentary, \"Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone,\" follows Zakaria and other children navigating the war's horrors, highlighting the devastating impact on their lives and futures.  Filmed by Gazan cameramen due to restricted access, the documentary shows children's struggles for survival, including finding food, shelter, and maintaining a semblance of normalcy amidst constant violence.  Zakaria's ambition to become a paramedic underscores the resilience and altered childhoods shaped by war.",

        "content": "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequiès, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.\nI expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.\nIt's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.\nHer husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.\nA friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.\nOne woman, Bénédicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".\n\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.\nLydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.\n\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"\nBut not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.\nThe railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.\nWhile I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.\nThere is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.\nThere is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.\nThe Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.\nOn top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.\nWhat attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. \nThe nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.\nVarious conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died – I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".\nEver since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.\nI asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.\nHe replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.\nDr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.\nThey were all either frightened or in shock, he said.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "content": "Jannik Sinner won the year's first grand slam and his third overall at the Australian Open\nWorld number one Jannik Sinner has accepted an immediate three-month ban from tennis after reaching a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) over his two positive drugs test last year.\nThe 23-year-old Italian, who last month won the Australian Open, is suspended from 9 February until 4 May.\nHe will be eligible to play in the year's next Grand Slam event, the French Open, which starts on 19 May.\nIn a statement on Saturday, Wada, which had appealed against the decision to clear Sinner to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), says it accepts his explanation that he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by his physiotherapist.\nThe body accepts the three-time Grand Slam champion \"did not intend to cheat\", that the drug \"did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit\" and this happened \"without his knowledge as the result of negligence of members of his entourage\".\nIt added: \"However, under the code and by virtue of Cas precedent, an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage's negligence. Based on the unique set of facts of this case, a three-month suspension is deemed to be an appropriate outcome.\"\nIn a statement released by his lawyers, Sinner said: \"This case had been hanging over me for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year.\n\"I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted Wada's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction.\"\nTennis has seen some high profile doping cases over the past six months, with leading female player Iga Swiatek accepting a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for a banned substance when she was world number one.\nSinner had previously been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned steroid clostebol in March 2024.\nIt had been accepted that he had been inadvertently contaminated by his physiotherapist, who was treating a cut on his hand with an over-the-counter spray, which was later found to contain the banned substance.\nThe International Tennis Integrity Agency said in August that the panel found Sinner bore \"no fault or negligence\" for testing positive for low levels of a metabolite of clostebol - a steroid that can be used to build muscle mass.\nBut Wada lodged an appeal with Cas last September stating at the time the finding of \"no fault or negligence\" was not correct under the applicable rules and it sought a ban of between one and two years, with a hearing scheduled for 16-17 April.\nThis has led to Sinner accepting the ban and the next tournament he can play in is the Italian Open, which begins on 7 May.\nHe will miss prestigious hard court tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami in the US, plus many of the clay tournaments that build-up to the French Open.\nWada says Sinner can return to \"official training activity\" from 13 April.\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone\nWorld number one Sinner banned for three months \nÂ£1.5bn spent & no striker in sight - how did Chelsea get here?\nEverton, Liverpool and Slot charged after derby melee\nThe tale of a billionaire family, stolen relics and fake treasure\nA scholar turned sleuth hunts stolen relics, exposing a scandal of biblical proportions\nPreview intense new crime drama, coming soon to BBC iPlayer\nDI Ffion Lloyd returns home to lead a murder investigation that mirrors a historic case\nThe company that revolutionised British television\nFrom the late 1950s to the early 1980s, ITC produced an incredible catalogue of shows\nA brand new DI lands on Saint Marie\nLondoner Mervin Wilson ruffles some feathers as he clashes with the islandâs way of life\nScholarship, hardship and an English rugby divide\nHow does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?\nSutton's predictions v The Wombats drummer & Everton fan Dan Haggis\n'Goodison was never going to go quietly - but this was something else'\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'\nWhat has derby drama done to title race? \nChampions Wigan the hunted as Super League returns\nEurope's best title race?

        "content": "The UK military is \"so run down\" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, the former head of the army has said.\nLord Dannatt told the BBC that up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and \"we just haven't got that number available\".\nIt comes after Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would \"play its part\" in guaranteeing Ukraine's security after the prime minister was asked this week if he was open to sending British troops as peacekeepers.\nA former Nato chief told the BBC that Britain and France should lead a force of up to 100,000 troops as part of a long-term peacekeeping effort should Russia's war with Ukraine end.\nUS President Donald Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the \"ridiculous war\" in Ukraine would begin \"immediately\". \nTrump then \"informed\" Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, of his plan. \nLord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - agreed that a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops. \nHowever he said the UK would have to supply \"quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it\".\n\"Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster.\n\"I mean, if we were to deploy 10,000 troops, each rotation for six months, that would effectively tie up 30,000 or 40,000 troops and we just haven't got that number available.\n\"So there are some big issues here that today's politicians won't really have considered.\"\nIt comes as Britain's foreign and defence secretaries called on the UK and Europe to \"do more\" to \"share the burden\" of regional security in a joint article for the Daily Telegraph on Saturday.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he was \"very encouraged\" by his talks on Ukraine with US Vice-President JD Vance on Friday, on the first day of the Munich Security Conference.\n\"We share the view that there has to be an enduring peace,\" Lammy told Reuters news agency following the meeting.\n\"There was an agreement that Zelensky and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal.\"\nThe talks came after Vance gave a speech at the conference, in which he was expected to address possible talks to end the war but instead attacked European democracies.\nIn the address, he said the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\".\nHe added that Europe must \"step up in a big way to provide for its own defence\" and said he hoped a \"reasonable settlement\" could be reached for the war.\nLammy and his defence colleague John Healey said that Putin had for two decades sought \"to recreate the Russian empire and suffocate the countries around its borders\".\n\"Too often in the past, the West has let him,\" they said in the Telegraph. \n\"We did too little in 2008 when he invaded Georgia, and in 2014 when he first went into Ukraine.\"\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen, who was Nato secretary-general from 2009 to 2014, said \"a number of European countries need to step up to the plate\" for any peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, adding that the UK and France should lead that coalition by putting boots on the ground.\n\"I would let military experts determine [the number] but my guess would be between 50,000 and 100,000 troops,\" he told BBC Newsnight.\nAs of October 2024, there were 74,612 members of the UK's regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latest Ministry of Defence (MoD) figures.\nThe Army has targets on how many new recruits below the rank of officer it should take on every year, set out by the MoD. These targets have been missed in almost every single financial year since 2010-11, according to a written answer to Parliament last January. \nLord Dannatt said the Labour government would need to \"look at their priorities\", adding: \"Yes, health, education, roads, infrastructure are important, but actually defence and the security of this nation are more important.\"\nThe crossbench peer said he believes the UK government needs to go further than its commitment of increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP - a pledge that they have yet to put a timeline on when it will be delivered.\nZelensky has previously asked for the UK and other European allies including France to send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping operation after the war.\nSir Keir last month signed a \"landmark\" 100-year pact with Ukraine, building on the £12.8bn the UK hass already sent to the country, with further commitments of £3bn every year for \"as long as it takes\".\nThe UK will also continue to train Ukrainian troops, 50,000 of whom have been trained on British soil so far.\nIn response to Lord Dannatt's comments, an MoD spokesperson said Britain's armed forces were \"respected worldwide for their professionalism and excellence\".\n\"Right now, the Ukrainians are still fighting with huge courage. Our government is stepping up support for Ukraine's war fighters to put them in the best possible position for any talks. \nThe spokesperson cited a £150m \"firepower package\" announced this week \"providing more drones, tanks and air defence systems\".\nThe vice-president's speech at the Munich Security Conference was denounced by several European leaders.\nIt comes as Ukraine and its European allies are still reacting to Trump's phone call with Putin. \nTrump and Putin want to make a deal. But Ukrainians question how life after a ceasefire will work. \nUkraine's president says he will not be shut out of peace negotiations after Trump says he agreed to start talks with Putin. \nThe BBC's Frank Gardner says Nato's unity is badly dented with decisions over Ukraine set to be discussed in Munich.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "The UK's former head of the army, Lord Dannatt, claims the UK military is too depleted to lead a potential Ukraine peacekeeping mission requiring 40,000-100,000 troops.  This follows statements by Sir Keir Starmer and a former NATO chief suggesting UK and French leadership in such a mission.  Despite recent UK defense spending pledges,  recruiting targets have been consistently missed.  Meanwhile, Trump announced direct talks with Putin to end the war, prompting concern and uncertainty from Ukraine and European allies about the peace process.

        "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgerr2jvkgo",
        "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 02:14:16 GMT",
        "content": "Elon Musk's children have been to places many will never see.\nFrom meetings with foreign leaders to the control room of a SpaceX launch, Musk's children have debuted as constant sidekicks to their father's endeavors in tech, business and now, politics.\nThey have made frequent appearances in the nation's capital since President Donald Trump tapped the tech billionaire and Tesla co-founder to lead the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency.\nMusk's four-year-old, \"Lil X\", hung on the corner of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday sporting a tan pea coat and a collared shirt.\nOn Thursday, X and two of his siblings exchanged gifts with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while their father discussed technology and innovation with the foreign leader.\nMusk has frequently been seen with his children even before coming to Washington - at a meeting with the president of Turkey, a memorial service at Auschwitz concentration camp, and a Time magazine ceremony where he was named the 2021 person of the year.\nBut why do Musk's children tag along?\n\"The inclusion of the kids in many public appearances is very much a politician move or a political move to make him seem a bit more personable (and) take a human approach to how the public views him,\" says Kurt Braddock, an American University professor of public communication.\nStill, Mr Braddock thought the decision to bring Musk's preschooler to the Oval Office was unusual.\nX appeared bored during the 30-minute press briefing as he mimicked his father, sat on the floor and received the occasional side glance and smile from the leader of the free world. At one point, it appeared he told someone in the room to \"shush\" their mouth.\nMr Braddock said he believes their inclusion is intentional - a distraction that benefits both Musk and Trump.\n\"I do think that there is a bit of a strategy here trying to draw attention to some things while diverting attention to other things,\" he said.\nJon Haber, a strategic communication consultant who has worked with five presidential campaigns and teaches at Harvard, said Musk's children making frequent appearances - and creating viral moments - is beneficial for Trump.\n\"For Trump, the more chaos, the more he floods the zone, the less anybody can really focus on. Chaos works for him,\" Mr Haber said.\nGrimes, Musk's ex-girlfriend and the mother of X, criticised her son's appearance in the Oval Office.\n\"He should not be in public like this,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"I did not see this… but I'm glad he was polite. Sigh.\"\nIn a 2022 Vanity Fair article, she said that she wasn't a fan of her son being in the spotlight.\n\"Whatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it, and X is just out there. I mean, I think E is really seeing him as a protégé and bringing him to everything and stuff.… X is out there. His situation is like that. But, yeah, I don't know.\"\nLong before politics, Musk allowed his children to tag along. \nA decade ago, when he was still building his profile and eager to draw attention to his electric-vehicle maker Tesla, it wasn't unusual to see them at events.\nAs analysts and reporters waited for one unveiling to begin at a Tesla facility in Silicon Valley in 2015, his five children could be seen running through the hallways chasing after each other and shrieking with laughter.\nDespite being forced to wait for hours for attendees, the presence of Musk's children created an atmosphere that felt relaxed and even joyous.\nIt was a departure from the stiff, far more formal events held by other companies for which the prospect of seeing an executive's very young children would have come across as odd.\nMusk has had 12 children with three different women.\nHis most-recognised son, X Æ A-12?, goes by \"Lil X\", the same letter Musk used to re-name Twitter when he purchased the social media company.\nThe four-year-old has been dubbed an \"emotional support human\" by Musk himself.\nWalter Isaacson, the author of Musk's biography, said on The Diary of a CEO podcast that Musk is \"deeply committed\" to his children and is \"almost obsessed by them\".\n\"With his own children, his lovers, his wives, there is the same intensity that is baked into everything he does,\" Mr Isaacson said.\n\"He always likes having some of his children around him.

        "summary": "Elon Musk's children have frequently accompanied him to high-profile events, including meetings with world leaders and appearances in the Oval Office.  This practice, viewed by some as a calculated political move to humanize Musk and create distractions, has drawn both praise and criticism.  While Musk views his children as companions and exhibits intense commitment to them, his ex-girlfriend Grimes expressed concern about their public exposure.
